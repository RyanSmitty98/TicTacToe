## Purpose
This project has been created to create a game of TicTacToe for two players.
It also has a time travel feature allowing the users to go back any number of moves that game.

## Setup
To run this project, after downlaoding, navigate to the file and use the "gatsby develop" comand.
In your web browser of choice enter "http://localhost:8000/" should automaticlly open and a 3x3 board will be displayed that accepts clicks to place either an 'X' or an 'O' in the spot.
The time control mechanic allows the player to go back in time just by pressing the corresponding button.
